codybot is an IRC bot written in C providing users with fortune cookies,
jokes, oneliner C compilation, shell access and weather per city.

The bot can connect to irc.freenode.net or any server using specified port
or 6697 by default for a SSL connection.

To compile the program, just run 'make' within the source directory
and run with './codybot -n YourNick'. Personally I run the bot in a virtual
machine to limit general system files accesses via the ^sh command. 
Run './codybot --help' to see all program options.

There is no installation mechanism, you should use the source directory
or copy the files where you want. The files 'ascii-art' 'stats' 'fortunes'
and 'jokes' must be in the program's current working directory otherwise
the program will not run.

You should run 'chown root fortunes jokes Makefile' so some
'^sh rm importantfiles' won't be able to execute... see
https://github.com/cody1632/codybot/security/advisories

You should register and identify with the IRC server's NickServer.
You can type '/msg NickServ help' in your favorite connected IRC client
(mIRC, irssi, weechat, hexchat, ...) Otherwise you can identify by typing
'id yourpasswordhere' or 'privmsg NickServ :identify pass' in the
console when running the codybot program. Another console-only command you
need to run is 'join #channel_name_here'.

To see available commands, send '^help' in the channel where the bot is.

To trigger a fortune cookie, just type '^fortune' in a channel where the bot
is present, like #codybot. The fortune cookie database file is 
data-fortunes.txt. It's made of concatenation of the linux, computers,
miscellaneous and wisdom files from /usr/share/games/fortunes using my
system-provided fortune package. (see https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod)

To get a random joke type '^joke'. This database is hand written using
https://www.funnyshortjokes.com content and is far from containing all
the sites' jokes! There's about 20 jokes as of 20190901.

To get weather report from https://wttr.in type '^weather citynamehere'
This should return something like "cancun: Partly cloudy 23C/73F"

To run a shell command from the chat onto the host of codybot, type
'^sh COMMAND ARGS' ie: '^sh ls /home/codybot'. You can disable this
command by touching sh_disable in the program's current directory
as the root user or by using the sudo program.

To run all shell commands in a locked chroot, touch './sh_lock' or
type '^sh_lock' or '^sh_unlock'. You have to run:
chroot ./lunar /bin/bash
su - dummy
run.sh
You should ensure that the codybot user can write to
lunar/home/dummy/run.fifo

Speaking of the lunar directory... it is a 64bit system I use
within a virtual machine (qemu-system-x86_64), those files may not
execute on 32bit machines... all ^sh commands will be run within
the chroot setup previously.
