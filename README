codybot is an IRC bot written in C providing users with fortune cookies
The bot can connect to irc.freenode.net using port 6697 for a SSL
connection.

To compile the program, just run 'make' within the source directory
and run with './codybot -n YourNick'. I don't recommend the -P/--password
options since the password can be seen when running '^sh ps -eo pid,cmd'

Consider changing the 'nick' value at the top of codybot.c if you plan
on registering a nick with NickServ as codybot is presently reserved, or
use the -n/--nick options.

You should register and identify with the IRC server's NickServer.
You can type '/msg NickServ help' in your connected IRC client.

To see available commands, send '^help' in the channel where the bot is.

To trigger a fortune cookie, just type '^fortune' in a channel where the bot
is present, like #codybot, ##c-offtopic or ##linux-offtopic

The fortune cookie database file is linux.fortune. It's made of concatenation
of linux, computers, miscellaneous and wisdom files from
/usr/share/games/fortunes from the system-provided fortune program.
