codybot is an IRC bot written in C providing users with fortune cookies
The bot can connect to irc.freenode.net using port 6697 for a SSL
connection.

To compile the program, just run 'make' with the source directory
and run with './codybot'

Consider changing the 'nick' value at the top of codybot.c if you plan
on registering a nick with NickServ as codybot is presently reserved.

To trigger a fortune cookie, just type '!fortune' in a channel where the bot
is present, like #codybot, ##c-offtopic or ##linux-offtopic
