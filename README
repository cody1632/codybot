codybot is an IRC bot written in C providing users with fortune cookies,
jokes, shell access and weather per city.

The bot can connect to irc.freenode.net or any server using specified port
or 6697 by default for a SSL connection.

To compile the program, just run 'make' within the source directory
and run with './codybot -n YourNick'. Personally I run the bot in a virtual
machine. 

There is no installation mechanism, you should use the source directory
or copy the files where you want. The files stats linux.fortune and jokes
must be in the program's current working directory unless the program
will not run.

You should run 'chown root linux.fortune jokes Makefile' so some
'^sh rm importantfiles' won't be able to execute...

You should register and identify with the IRC server's NickServer.
You can type '/msg NickServ help' in your favorite connected IRC client
(mIRC, irssi, weechat, hexchat, ...) You can identify by typing
'id yourpasswordhere' or 'privmsg NickServ :identify pass'

To see available commands, send '^help' in the channel where the bot is.

To trigger a fortune cookie, just type '^fortune' in a channel where the bot
is present, like #codybot, ##c-offtopic or ##linux-offtopic.
The fortune cookie database file is linux.fortune. It's made of concatenation
of linux, computers, miscellaneous and wisdom files from
/usr/share/games/fortunes from the system-provided fortune program.
(see https://github.com/shlomif/fortune-mod)

To get a random joke type '^joke'. This database is hand written using
https://www.funnyshortjokes.com content and is far from containing all
the sites' jokes! There's about 20 jokes as of 20190901.

To get weather report from https://wttr.in type '^weather citynamehere'
This should return something like "cancun: Partly cloudy 23C/73F"
