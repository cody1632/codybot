codybot is an IRC bot written in C providing users with fortune cookies
The bot can connect to irc.freenode.net using port 6697 for a SSL
connection.

To compile the program, just run 'make' with the source directory
and run with './codybot'

Note that you will need to generate openSSL certificate and key using those commands:

openssl req -new > cert.csr
openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out key.pem
openssl x509 -in cert.csr -out cert.pem -req -signkey key.pem -days 1001
cat key.pem >> cert.pem
rm cert.csr privkey.pem

To trigger a fortune cookie, just type '!fortune' in a channel where the bot
is present, like #codybot, ##c-offtopic or ##linux-offtopic
